## FourTwenty Analytics — Modular Dashboard Sandbox

- My portfolio is structured as a modular sandbox I call FourTwenty Analytics. 
- Each repository is a model within an orbit — 🚀 The Launch, 🫀 The Archive, 📡 The Signal, 🏦 The Bank, and others — that together 
simulate the systems a data analyst navigates in the real world. 
- This lets me practice end-to-end craft: framing problems in YAML specs, validating with QA rules, pulsing with daily signals, 
and archiving immutable evidence. 
- It’s not just code; it’s a living ecosystem where I sharpen analysis, consistency, and storytelling — the same skills I bring into a role.
*Scrollkeeper Note --> My suns can wander all they want as long as 4/20 is seeded.


## Scaffolding 
-**Seeding**
 - `index.html`: portfolio website.  
 - `README.md`: this scroll meant to be a running broadcast of how FourTwenty Analytics is built.
 - `hub_pat.md`: The constellation API token; while this is generally a secret, this portfolio is public facing, so there is no PII.
 - `assets/`: a set of images specific to FourTwenty Analytics.
 - `schema/`: even living seeds need machine genetics; these .yml files define the seeds in machine language. 
 - `seeds/`: a collection of data seeds meant to create a living system of modules; these seeds all maintain home repo genetics as the constellation grows.
 - `signals/`: a collection of constellation signals picked up by The Signal for broadcasting portfolio development.
 - `scripts/`: a collection of Python scripts intended to facilitate constellation processes.
 - `scrubs/`: a collection of QA scripts meant to periodically clean constellation data.
 - `.github/workflows/validate_seeds.yml`: validates seed structures against schemas.

-**Developmental Funnels**
 - `scrolls/`: A collection of creative writing scrolls meant for ideation.


## Orbitals

- Elemental System Creed

>> ⚛️ The Elemental System is the epicenter of the constellation — the force that keeps every star aligned.  

   - 🔘 **The Barycenter** → presents **gravity**  
      - All data seeds emanate from the hub.

>>>This system exists so that all other systems exist.

--

- 🌌 Core System Creed

>>The Core System consists of the stars that support metaphorical life for the constellation — the foundation that keeps every other orbit aligned.  
Each star has a distinct mission:

   - 🚀 **The Launch** → promotes **consistency**  
      - Ensures new suns are seeded with repeatable, reliable foundations. Think genetic normalization.

   - 🫀 **The Archive** → promotes **longevity**  
      - Breathes life into the constellation by maintaining memory, seeds, and history. Think master of the scrolls.

   - 📡 **The Signal** → promotes **opportunity**  
      - Acts as the nervous system — scanning outward and broadcasting inward to find value. Think curiosity.

   - 🛡️ **The Protector** → promotes **integrity**  
     - Safeguards the constellation by hardening workflows, monitoring health, and shortening recovery time. Think fortification and adaptability. 

>>>These Core Systems work together so the constellation remains consistent, long-lived, opportunistic, and trustworthy.

- 🌌 Delivery & Insight Creed

>>The Core Systems are the heartbeat of the constellation — the foundation that keeps every orbit aligned.  
Each system has a distinct mission:

   - 🚀 **The Launch** → promotes **consistency**  
      - Ensures new suns are seeded with repeatable, reliable foundations.

   - 🫀 **The Archive** → promotes **longevity**  
      - Breathes life into the constellation by maintaining memory, seeds, and history.

   - 📡 **The Signal** → promotes **opportunity**  
      - Acts as the nervous system — scanning outward and broadcasting inward to find value.

   - 🛡️ **The Protector** → promotes **integrity**  
     - Safeguards the constellation by hardening workflows, monitoring health, and shortening recovery time.

## Seeds

--> seeds/glossary.yml <--

- key: Stable, machine-friendly identifier in snake_case. Must be unique and should never change (other files may reference it).
- term: Human-readable label (usually Title Case). Safe to tweak for wording, since references should point to key, not term.
- definition: Plain-language explanation for humans. Use > (folded block) so it reads as one paragraph. Start with a crisp one-sentence summary; add a second line for nuance if needed.
- examples: Short, real uses (1–3 items). Each item is a concise string that shows the term in context—an action, artifact, or sentence fragment.
- see_also: List of related keys (not terms). Helps cross-link concepts within your docs.

- key: your_snake_case_key
  term: "Your Term"
  definition: >
    One-sentence summary.
    Optional second sentence with context or scope.
  examples:
    - "Short example showing use"
  see_also: ["related_key_1", "related_key_2"]

- key: portfolio
  term: "Portfolio"
  definition: >
    Content intended for external viewing (landing pages, demos, docs).
    Aggregates public entry points across modules.
  examples:
    - "Launch Model GitHub Pages site"
  see_also: ["launch", "entry"]

--> seeds/tags.yml <--

# key: Stable, machine-friendly identifier in snake_case. Must be unique and should not change (dashboards and docs may reference it).
# label: Human-readable display name (Title Case). Safe to tweak without breaking references (consumers should point to key).
# description: Plain-language summary for humans. Use > (folded block) so it reads as one paragraph. Start with a crisp one-sentence summary; add an optional second line for nuance.
# kind: Category for grouping/filters. Choose one from the allowed set:
  # audience, navigation, discipline, standard, framework, role, analytics_type, repository, pipeline, streaming, platform, knowledge, technique, process, language, format, credential, organization, capability, governance, requirements,  practice, planning, source, concept, skills
# gloss_ref: The key of a related entry in seeds/glossary.yml. Validates cross-linking and keeps tags fewer than glossary terms.
# deprecated: Boolean flag. Set to true to retire a tag without breaking older artifacts; prefer introducing a replacement tag and updating references over time.

- key: your_snake_case_tag
  label: "Your Label"
  description: >
    One-sentence summary of how this tag is used across modules or docs.
    Optional second sentence with scope or examples of where it applies.
  kind: analytics_type must include: ["module","topic","kpi","status","orbit","tech"]
  gloss_ref: your_glossary_key
  deprecated: false

- key: portfolio
  label: "Portfolio"
  description: >
    Public-facing entry artifacts across the constellation.
  kind: orbit
  gloss_ref: portfolio
  deprecated: false

Notes: Keep tags.yml intentionally smaller than glossary.yml; use it as the cross-module “integration surface.” When in doubt, put specifics in the glossary and map them to a broader tag via gloss_ref.
