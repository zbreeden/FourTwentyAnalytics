## FourTwenty Analytics — Modular Dashboard Sandbox

- My portfolio is structured as a modular sandbox I call FourTwenty Analytics. 
- Each repository is a model within an orbit — 🚀 The Launch, 🫀 The Archive, 📡 The Signal, 🏦 The Bank, and others — that together 
simulate the systems a data analyst navigates in the real world. 
- This lets me practice end-to-end craft: framing problems in YAML specs, validating with QA rules, pulsing with daily signals, 
and archiving immutable evidence. 
- It’s not just code; it’s a living ecosystem where I sharpen analysis, consistency, and storytelling — the same skills I bring into a role.
- **Scrollkeeper Note** --> My suns can wander all they want as long as 4/20 is seeded.

## FourTwenty Genesis - Executable Book

- The FourTwenty Analytics Genesis Machine isn't just a technical tool—it's a **revolutionary literary form** where machine execution and human narrative coexist in perfect harmony. This polyglot notebook represents a new genre: **the Executable Book**.
  - Traditional books ask you to **read about** something. Technical manuals ask you to **follow steps** to build something.
  - The Genesis Machine asks you to **experience the creation** while it happens.
  - When someone opens `FourTwentyGenesis.dib` and hits **"Run All"**, they don't just learn about analytics platforms—they **witness the birth of one** while experiencing the story of Chloe, the AI advisor who emerges from the validated data flows.

 ### What Readers Get

- ✅ **Entertainment**: Engaging narrative with Chloe
- ✅ **Education**: Learn constellation architecture
- ✅ **Practical Tool**: Working analytics foundation
- ✅ **Experience**: Witness creation firsthand
- ✅ **Artifacts**: Keep the generated system

## 📦 Perfect Portability

The entire book experience is contained in a single `.dib` file:

- **Send via email**: Complete book + runtime environment
- **Demo distribution**: Recipients build the system locally
- **Version control**: Book evolution tracked through Git
- **Community editions**: Collaborative storytelling through code

## 🎪 Genre-Defining Characteristics

### The Executable Book

- **Chronological**: Sequential cell execution = chapter progression
- **Interactive**: Reader participates in creation
- **Generative**: Produces artifacts beyond the reading experience
- **Repeatable**: Each "reading" (run) creates fresh genesis
- **Personalized**: Generated content belongs to the reader
- **Demonstrable**: Can be shared and re-experienced

## 🌟 The Meta-Achievement

This book is **about** creating analytics platforms, but the **act of reading it** creates an analytics platform. The **medium IS the message**.

You don't just learn about constellation architecture—you **become the architect** of your own constellation. You don't just read about Chloe—you **witness her awakening** in your environment.

## 🎭 Computational Storytelling

The Genesis Machine proves that **infrastructure can be poetry**. It doesn't just build systems—it **performs the creation myth** while building them.

This is where:

- Technical documentation becomes interactive fiction
- Code execution becomes narrative progression
- Schema validation becomes character development
- System architecture becomes world-building

## 🚀 The Future of Technical Literature

The Genesis Machine launches a new category: **Bibliography**—books that write themselves into existence through the reader's participation.

Imagine:

- **"The Kubernetes Chronicles"**: Deploy clusters while experiencing the orchestration epic
- **"Database Genesis"**: Watch schemas evolve as the data story unfolds
- **"The API Awakening"**: Build services while following the microservices narrative

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- VS Code with Polyglot Notebooks extension
- .NET runtime
- A willingness to participate in creation

### The Command

```bash
# Open the book
code FourTwentyGenesis.dib

# Read/Run the book (Ctrl+F5 or "Run All")
# Experience the genesis
# Keep the constellation
```

## 🌌 Join the Revolution

The Genesis Machine represents more than a tool—it's a **new way of sharing knowledge** where the learning process creates lasting value for both teacher and student.

**This is computational storytelling at its finest, where the act of running code becomes the act of experiencing narrative, and technical achievement becomes inseparable from human meaning.**

## Scaffolding 
-**Seeding**
 - `index.html`: portfolio website.  
 - `README.md`: this scroll meant to be a running broadcast of how FourTwenty Analytics is built.
 - `hub_pat.md`: The constellation API token; while this is generally a secret, this portfolio is public facing, so there is no PII.
 - `assets/`: a set of images specific to FourTwenty Analytics.
 - `schema/`: even living seeds need machine genetics; these .yml files define the seeds in machine language. 
 - `seeds/`: a collection of data seeds meant to create a living system of modules; these seeds all maintain home repo genetics as the constellation grows.
 - `signals/`: a collection of constellation signals picked up by The Signal for broadcasting portfolio development.
 - `scripts/`: a collection of Python scripts intended to facilitate constellation processes.
 - `scrubs/`: a collection of QA scripts meant to periodically clean constellation data.
 - `.github/workflows/validate_seeds.yml`: validates seed structures against schemas.

-**Developmental Funnels**
 - `scrolls/`: A collection of creative writing scrolls meant for ideation.

## Seeds

--> seeds/glossary.yml <--

- key: Stable, machine-friendly identifier in snake_case. Must be unique and should never change (other files may reference it).
- term: Human-readable label (usually Title Case). Safe to tweak for wording, since references should point to key, not term.
- definition: Plain-language explanation for humans. Use > (folded block) so it reads as one paragraph. Start with a crisp one-sentence summary; add a second line for nuance if needed.
- examples: Short, real uses (1–3 items). Each item is a concise string that shows the term in context—an action, artifact, or sentence fragment.
- see_also: List of related keys (not terms). Helps cross-link concepts within your docs.

- key: your_snake_case_key
  term: "Your Term"
  definition: >
    One-sentence summary.
    Optional second sentence with context or scope.
  examples:
    - "Short example showing use"
  see_also: ["related_key_1", "related_key_2"]

- key: portfolio
  term: "Portfolio"
  definition: >
    Content intended for external viewing (landing pages, demos, docs).
    Aggregates public entry points across modules.
  examples:
    - "Launch Model GitHub Pages site"
  see_also: ["launch", "entry"]

--> seeds/tags.yml <--

# key: Stable, machine-friendly identifier in snake_case. Must be unique and should not change (dashboards and docs may reference it).
# label: Human-readable display name (Title Case). Safe to tweak without breaking references (consumers should point to key).
# description: Plain-language summary for humans. Use > (folded block) so it reads as one paragraph. Start with a crisp one-sentence summary; add an optional second line for nuance.
# kind: Category for grouping/filters. Choose one from the allowed set:
  # audience, navigation, discipline, standard, framework, role, analytics_type, repository, pipeline, streaming, platform, knowledge, technique, process, language, format, credential, organization, capability, governance, requirements,  practice, planning, source, concept, skills
# gloss_ref: The key of a related entry in seeds/glossary.yml. Validates cross-linking and keeps tags fewer than glossary terms.
# deprecated: Boolean flag. Set to true to retire a tag without breaking older artifacts; prefer introducing a replacement tag and updating references over time.

- key: your_snake_case_tag
  label: "Your Label"
  description: >
    One-sentence summary of how this tag is used across modules or docs.
    Optional second sentence with scope or examples of where it applies.
  kind: analytics_type must include: ["module","topic","kpi","status","orbit","tech"]
  gloss_ref: your_glossary_key
  deprecated: false

- key: portfolio
  label: "Portfolio"
  description: >
    Public-facing entry artifacts across the constellation.
  kind: orbit
  gloss_ref: portfolio
  deprecated: false

Notes: Keep tags.yml intentionally smaller than glossary.yml; use it as the cross-module “integration surface.” When in doubt, put specifics in the glossary and map them to a broader tag via gloss_ref.
