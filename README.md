##FourTwenty Analytics — Modular Dashboard Sandbox

My portfolio is structured as a modular sandbox I call FourTwenty Analytics. Each repository is a model within an orbit — 🚀 The Launch, 🫀 The Archive, 📡 The Signal, 🏦 The Bank, and others — that together simulate the systems a data analyst navigates in the real world. This lets me practice end-to-end craft: framing problems in YAML specs, validating with QA rules, pulsing with daily signals, and archiving immutable evidence. It’s not just code; it’s a living ecosystem where I sharpen analysis, consistency, and storytelling — the same skills I bring into a role.
