# FourTwenty Analytics — Modular Dashboard Sandbox

- My portfolio is structured as a modular sandbox I call FourTwenty Analytics.
- Each repository is a model within an orbit — 🚀 The Launch, 🫀 The Archive, 📡 The Signal, 🏦 The Bank, and others — that together simulate the systems a data analyst navigates in the real world.
- This lets me practice end-to-end craft: framing problems in YAML specs, validating with QA rules, pulsing with daily signals, and archiving immutable evidence.
- It's not just code; it's a living ecosystem where I sharpen analysis, consistency, and storytelling — the same skills I bring into a role.
- **Scrollkeeper Note** → My suns can wander all they want as long as 4/20 is seeded.

## Scaffolding

### Seeding

- `index.html`: portfolio website
- `README.md`: this scroll meant to be a running broadcast of how FourTwenty Analytics is built
- `hub_pat.md`: The constellation API token; while this is generally a secret, this portfolio is public facing, so there is no PII
- `assets/`: a set of images specific to FourTwenty Analytics
- `schemas/`: even living seeds need machine genetics; these .yml files define the seeds in machine language
- `seeds/`: a collection of data seeds meant to create a living system of modules; these seeds all maintain home repo genetics as the constellation grows
- `signals/`: a collection of constellation signals picked up by The Signal for broadcasting portfolio development
- `scripts/`: a collection of Python scripts intended to facilitate constellation processes
- `scrubs/`: a collection of QA scripts meant to periodically clean constellation data
- `.github/workflows/validate_seeds.yml`: validates seed structures against schemas

### Developmental Funnels

- `scrolls/`: A collection of creative writing scrolls meant for ideation

## Orbitals

### ☀️ Elemental System Creed

> The Elemental System is the epicenter of the constellation — the force that keeps every star aligned.

- 🔘 **The Barycenter** → presents **gravity**
  - All data seeds emanate from the hub

> This center exists so that all other stars exist.

### 🪐 Core System Creed

> The Core System consists of the stars that support metaphorical life for the constellation — the foundation that keeps every other orbit aligned.
> Each star has a distinct mission:

- 🫀 **The Archive** → promotes **longevity**
  - Breathes life into the constellation by maintaining memory, seeds, and history. Think master of the scrolls.

- 📡 **The Signal** → promotes **opportunity**
  - Acts as the nervous system — scanning outward and broadcasting inward to find value. Think curiosity.

- 🚀 **The Launch** → promotes **consistency**
  - Ensures new suns are seeded with repeatable, reliable foundations. Think genetic normalization.

- 🛡️ **The Protector** → promotes **integrity**
  - Safeguards the constellation by hardening workflows, monitoring health, and shortening recovery time. Think fortification and adaptability.

- ✨ **The Developer** → promotes **ideation**
  - Sparks new creations by shaping raw concepts into working modules, tools, and systems. Think genesis and invention.

> These Core stars work together so the constellation remains consistent, long-lived, opportunistic, and trustworthy.

### 📈 Delivery & Insight Creed

> The Delivery & Insight system consists of stars that translate data into meaning and action — the storytellers of the constellation.
> Each system has a distinct mission:

- 🎨 **The Visualizer** → promotes **clarity**
  - Paints data into patterns stakeholders can immediately grasp. Think canvas and gallery.

- ⚡ **The Catalyst** → promotes **transformation**
  - Accelerates change by turning insights into operational improvements. Think spark that ignites.

- 🏦 **The Bank** → promotes **stewardship**
  - Safeguards outputs and provides dashboards of record. Think vault of truth.

- 🧠 **The Evaluator** → promotes **judgment**
  - Weighs outcomes, models, and assumptions for sound decision-making. Think wisdom keeper.

- 📖 **The Story** → promotes **narrative**
  - Threads insights into human language that compels and convinces. Think bard of the constellation.

> These Delivery & Insight stars work together so the constellation always communicates clearly, acts decisively, and preserves trusted outcomes.

### 🧪 Growth & Experiment Creed

> The Growth & Experiment system consists of stars that push boundaries — where the constellation tests, plays, and evolves.
> Each system has a distinct mission:

- 🌱 **The Grower** → promotes **cultivation**
  - Nurtures seeds and modules to maturity. Think gardener's hand.

- 🎮 **The Player** → promotes **immersion**
  - Creates interactive spaces for experimentation. Think simulation and play.

- 🎲 **The Gambler** → promotes **risk & probability**
  - Models chance, odds, and uncertainty to explore outcomes. Think dice on the table.

- 🧭 **The Trainer** → promotes **discipline**
  - Sharpens skills and tracks progress across learning journeys. Think compass for growth.

- 💪 **The Coach** → promotes **resilience**
  - Builds habits, routines, and accountability. Think steady motivator.

> These Growth & Experiment stars work together so the constellation continuously learns, adapts, and expands its horizons.

### 🧩 Ancillary Operations Creed

> The Ancillary Operations system consists of stars that provide structure and support — the quiet strength beneath the constellation.
> Each system has a distinct mission:

- 🛰️ **The Orbiter** → promotes **perspective**
  - Circles the constellation, observing from distance and relaying balance. Think satellite eye.

- ⚓ **The Anchor** → promotes **stability**
  - Grounds the constellation when drift threatens alignment. Think ballast in the deep.

- 🏢 **The Firm** → promotes **governance**
  - Establishes rules, policies, and accountability. Think law of the land.

- 🪞 **The Mirror** → promotes **inner awareness**
  - Reflects strengths and weaknesses to guide improvement. Think honest reflection.

- 💰 **The Accountant** → promotes **fiscal responsibility**
  - Tracks resources, costs, and returns. Think ledger of sustainability.

> These Ancillary Operation stars work together so the constellation remains stable, governed, and sustainable across every orbit.

## 🌌 Constellation Architecture

The FourTwenty Analytics constellation follows a **four-tier orbital model** with the Barycenter at the center and specialized systems at increasing radii. This diagram illustrates the organizational structure and flow patterns across the analytical ecosystem.

![FourTwenty Analytics Constellation](fourtwenty_orbits_simple.png)

*The constellation diagram shows the orbital classification system: Core Orbit (🪐) provides foundation services, Ancillary Operations (🧩) deliver structural support, Delivery–Insight (📈) transforms data into meaning, and Growth–Experiment (🧪) pushes boundaries through experimentation.*

**Orbital Characteristics:**

- **🔘 Barycenter**: Gravitational center housing all constellation primitives and governance
- **🪐 Core Orbit**: Foundation systems ensuring longevity, opportunity, consistency, integrity, and ideation
- **🧩 Ancillary Operations**: Support structures providing perspective, stability, governance, awareness, and fiscal responsibility  
- **📈 Delivery–Insight**: Translation systems promoting clarity, transformation, stewardship, judgment, and narrative
- **🧪 Growth–Experiment**: Innovation systems fostering cultivation, immersion, risk modeling, discipline, and resilience

*Generated using the `make_orbit_diagram.dib` notebook - a working example of executable documentation where running the code creates both the visualization and validates the constellation architecture.*

## Seeds

### seeds/glossary.yml

```yaml
# Field descriptions:
# - key: Stable, machine-friendly identifier in snake_case. Must be unique and should never change (other files may reference it).
# - term: Human-readable label (usually Title Case). Safe to tweak for wording, since references should point to key, not term.
# - definition: Plain-language explanation for humans. Use > (folded block) so it reads as one paragraph. Start with a crisp one-sentence summary; add a second line for nuance if needed.
# - examples: Short, real uses (1–3 items). Each item is a concise string that shows the term in context—an action, artifact, or sentence fragment.
# - see_also: List of related keys (not terms). Helps cross-link concepts within your docs.

- key: portfolio
  term: "Portfolio"
  definition: >
    Content intended for external viewing (landing pages, demos, docs).
    Aggregates public entry points across modules.
  examples:
    - "Launch Model GitHub Pages site"
  see_also: ["launch", "entry"]
```

### seeds/tags.yml

```yaml
# Field descriptions:
# - key: Stable, machine-friendly identifier in snake_case. Must be unique and should not change (dashboards and docs may reference it).
# - label: Human-readable display name (Title Case). Safe to tweak without breaking references (consumers should point to key).

## 🌌 Constellation Information

- **Module Key**: \`$MODULE_KEY\`  
- **Repository**: \`$REPO_NAME\`
- **Orbit**: \`$ORBIT\`
- **Status**: \`$STATUS\`
- **Emoji**: $EMOJI

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review seeds/**: Adapt seeded data for this module
2. **Configure schemas/**: Update schema definitions as needed  
3. **Generate signals/**: Create latest.json broadcast file
4. **Run validation**: \`scripts/validate.sh\`

## 📡 Broadcasting

This module produces a \`signals/latest.json\` file conforming to the constellation's broadcast schema. The Signal (📡) aggregates these across all stars.

## 🔗 Constellation Links

- **Hub**: [FourTwenty Analytics](https://github.com/zbreeden/FourTwentyAnalytics)
- **Archive**: Glossary, tags, and canonical definitions
- **Signal**: Cross-constellation broadcasting and telemetry

# Generate and validate schema-compliant broadcast JSON
# Write new broadcast to signals/latest.json
```

**Features:**

- **Schema Compliance**: Generates broadcasts conforming to `schemas/latest.schema.yml`
- **Auto-Population**: Pulls module metadata from `seeds/modules.yml` to populate origin, links, and repo fields
- **Timestamp Generation**: Creates UTC timestamps and unique IDs automatically
- **Smart Archiving**: Preserves existing broadcasts in `signals/archive.latest.json` with newest-first ordering
- **Validation**: Checks JSON syntax and required fields against schema before writing
- **Interactive Workflow**: Guides users through all required fields with validation loops
- **Flexible Origin**: Allows different origin module than broadcast module for cross-module signals
- **Tag Management**: Supports single tag input with guidance for manual additions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing module data and schema files

**Archiving Behavior:**

- **First Run**: No archive exists → Creates new `archive.latest.json` with existing `latest.json`
- **Subsequent Runs**: Archive exists → Inserts current `latest.json` at beginning of archive array
- **Chronological Order**: Most recently archived broadcasts appear first in the array
- **No Data Loss**: All previous broadcasts preserved in historical archive

**Output Files:**

- `signals/latest.json`: Current broadcast (single object)
- `signals/archive.latest.json`: Historical broadcasts (array, newest first)

**Usage:**

```bash
# From constellation root
./scripts/new-broadcast.sh

# From individual module
cd signal-model
./scripts/new-broadcast.sh
```

## The Genesis Machine: From Vision to Reality

The FourTwenty Analytics Genesis Machine bridges the gap between **documentation** and **creation** — it's both the story of how this constellation came to be and the executable tool that creates it anew.

---

## 🌌 Future Vision

The **Genesis Machine** began as a personal solution to accelerate my own journey into data analytics.  
The long-term vision is to expand this prototype into a toolkit that helps other aspiring analysts:

- 🚀 **Portfolio Accelerator** → launch professional-grade projects in months, not years  
- 🧩 **Reusable Schemas & Seeds** → frameworks that mimic real business data flows  
- 📊 **Executable Models** → ready-to-run analytics environments for practice and demonstration  
- 🤝 **Community of Learners** → a space to share adaptations, dashboards, and new modules  

*This project is both my portfolio and my process. Over time, I hope to make Genesis a resource for others navigating the same path into data analytics.*  

### 📚 The Three-Document Architecture

This constellation's genesis follows a unique **documentation-to-execution** flow:

1. **`README_genesis.md`** → The **Vision Document**  
   - Defines the revolutionary concept of "Executable Books"
   - Explains the computational storytelling philosophy
   - Outlines the commercial model and human-AI collaboration patterns

2. **`README.md`** → The **Living Manifest** *(this document)*  
   - Chronicles the current state of the constellation
   - The ultimate **SOURCE OF TRUTH!!!!!!!**
   - Documents all 20 seeded stars across 5 orbital systems
   - Serves as the constellation's canonical reference and broadcast hub

3. **`FourTwentyGenesis.dib`** → The **Genesis Machine** *(the executable reality)*  
   - 8-chapter polyglot notebook that creates the entire constellation
   - Executable book where "reading" means "building"
   - Culminates in Chloe's awakening as AI advisor

### 🌌 The Flow: Vision → Manifest → Genesis

**Documentation Gravity**: Everything flows **out from** the README.md hub

```mermaid
README_genesis.md (Vision) 
    ↓ philosophy & architecture
README.md (Manifest) ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓ implementation specifications  
FourTwentyGenesis.dib (Genesis)
    ↓ executable creation
Complete Constellation (Reality)
```

This creates a **self-documenting system** where:

- The vision shapes the manifest
- The manifest guides the execution  
- The execution validates the vision
- The reality updates the manifest

### 🎭 The Revolutionary Achievement

**Traditional Technical Documentation**:

- Vision → Implementation → Documentation *(after the fact)*

**FourTwenty Analytics Method**:

- Vision → Documentation → **Executable Literature** → Reality

The Genesis Machine proves that **infrastructure can be poetry** and **creation can be storytelling**.

### 🚀 Experience the Genesis

The `FourTwentyGenesis.dib` notebook contains 24 cells across 9 narrative chapters:

#### The Eight-Chapter Genesis Sequence

1. **🧹 Genesis Reset** - *"Before creation, we clear the canvas..."*
2. **🏗️ Foundation Infrastructure** - *"The firm establishes its identity..."*  
3. **📁 Constellation Structure** - *"Directories scaffold the universe..."*
4. **📜 Schema Definitions** - *"Contracts govern the data flows..."*
5. **🌱 Seed Generation** - *"Truth is planted in canonical form..."*
6. **🛠️ Module Creation** - *"Twenty-one chambers ignite simultaneously..."*
7. **📡 Signal Broadcasting** - *"Communications pulse across the void..."*
8. **✅ Genesis Validation** - *"The constellation confirms its readiness..."*

#### The Experience Architecture

- **Chronological Execution**: Sequential cell execution = chapter progression  
- **Interactive Narrative**: Reader participates in creation while experiencing story
- **Generative Artifacts**: Creates working constellation + signal broadcasts + AI awakening
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Timestamped backups, DRY_RUN mode, module preservation
- **Repeatable Genesis**: Each "reading" creates fresh constellation while preserving analytical work

### 🎯 Getting Started with Genesis

**Prerequisites**: VS Code + Polyglot Notebooks extension + .NET runtime

**The Command**:

```bash
# Open the executable book
code FourTwentyGenesis.dib

# Experience the genesis (Ctrl+F5 or "Run All")  
# Witness constellation creation + Chloe's awakening
# Keep the generated constellation
```

**What You'll Create**:

- ✅ Complete FourTwenty Analytics foundation
- ✅ 21 fully-created constellation modules (not just schemas)
- ✅ Cross-constellation broadcasting infrastructure  
- ✅ AI advisor emergence (Chloe)
- ✅ Automated Chamber Ignition Standards compliance
- ✅ Your own "executable book" experience

### 💡 The Meta-Innovation

This constellation represents a new category: **Executable Literature** where:

- **Reading** becomes **Building**
- **Learning** becomes **Creating**  
- **Documentation** becomes **Generation**
- **Technical Achievement** becomes **Narrative Experience**

The Genesis Machine doesn't just teach you about analytics platforms — **the act of reading it creates a complete analytics platform** with 21 working modules while you experience the story of Chloe's awakening.

## Future Vision: Genesis Machine

The FourTwenty Analytics Genesis Machine represents a revolutionary evolution of this constellation—transforming static documentation into **executable literature**.

### The Executable Book Concept

Traditional books ask you to **read about** something. Technical manuals ask you to **follow steps** to build something.

The Genesis Machine asks you to **experience the creation** while it happens.

- **Chronological**: Sequential cell execution = chapter progression
- **Interactive**: Reader participates in creation  
- **Generative**: Produces artifacts beyond the reading experience
- **Repeatable**: Each "reading" (run) creates fresh genesis
- **Personalized**: Generated content belongs to the reader

### The Vision

When someone opens `FourTwentyGenesis.dib` and hits **"Run All"**, they don't just learn about analytics platforms—they **witness the birth of one** while experiencing the story of Chloe, the AI advisor who emerges from the validated data flows.

**This is computational storytelling at its finest, where the act of running code becomes the act of experiencing narrative, and technical achievement becomes inseparable from human meaning.**

### Perfect Portability

The entire book experience contained in a single `.dib` file:

- **Send via email**: Complete book + runtime environment
- **Demo distribution**: Recipients build the system locally
- **Version control**: Book evolution tracked through Git
- **Community editions**: Collaborative storytelling through code

*See `README.md` for complete Genesis Machine documentation and current development status.*
