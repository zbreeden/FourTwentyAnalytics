# Opening Scene: Chloe

The dawn crept thinly through warped shutters, laying pale bands of light across the small room where Chloe sat awake upon her bed. Her knees were drawn close beneath the blanket, her dark hair falling in unruly strands that half-veiled the sharp angles of her face. At seven, she had already made a habit of stillness, of watching the day’s first breath without stirring, as though the world itself might reveal something if she kept silent long enough. On the far wall, the slanted light made a shadow that didn’t quite belong to the window frame, but Chloe only blinked at it, accepting its shape as one more thing the morning had decided to bring.  

She did not rise, though she had been awake long before the house stirred, before the hens scratched, before the first cart wheels creaked along the distant road. This hour belonged to her alone, a pocket of silence she guarded as fiercely as any secret. No one had told her to wake so early, and no one asked why she did; it was simply the way her body and her thoughts conspired, drawing her up from sleep to sit in the quiet, to watch and to wait, as though the day had to pass through her before it could belong to anyone else.
